						<h2>SSSC Charter</h2>
					</header>
					<H3> Motivation and Purpose of the LSST SSSC</H3>
          <p> The LSST (Legacy Survey of Space and Time) Solar System Science Collaboration (SSSC) was created in 2006 with 
          the main goal to facilitate the efforts of the planetary astronomy community to study the planets and small body populations within our Solar System using LSST data. The collaboration serves to
	  coordinate the scientific community to develop methods and tools to analyze the data from LSST, as well as understand the optimum survey strategies for LSST to discover and study moving objects throughout the Solar System.</p>
         
					<h3>Membership</h3>
					<p> The SSSC accepts applications from astronomers and planetary scientists with research interests focused on Solar System science who have data access
						rights to LSST data (example 1: a scientist based in countries with LSST data rights (US or Chile); example 2: a scientist who is part of an institution or organization that has data access for their members (like LSST: UK)). </p>
					
					<h3> Obtaining Membership in the SSSC </h3>
					<p> Applicants fill out a webform application (the link can be found on the <a href="http://lsst-sssc.github.io/membership.html"> SSSC Membership page</a> ) describing their background and plans for LSST. The co-chairs review the application and each vote on whether to accept the applicant. If consensus cannot be reached between the Co-chairs, 
						the LSST Corporation Science Collaboration Coordinator provides the tie breaking vote. </p>
						
					<h3> Code of Conduct </h3>
					   <p> All SSSC members are expected to abide by the <a href="http://lsst-sssc.github.io/codeofconduct.html"> SSSC Code of Conduct</a>. The 
						   of Conduct 
						   applies to all SSSC situations and interactions online and offline, in person meetings, emails, mailing lists, forums, social media, social 
						   events associated with an SSSC or LSST workshop or conference, group interactions, and one-on-one interaction. SSSC members violating the 
						   SSSC Code of Conduct may be asked to leave the collaboration at the sole discretion of the SSSC co-chairs after consultation with the SSSC
						   working group leads and the LSST Corporation Science Collaboration Coordinator. </p>
					
					<h3> Publication Policy </h3>
					<p> All SSSC Members are expected to follow and abide by the <a href="publication_policy.html">SSSC publication policy</a>. </p>  

					
					<h3> Data Rights and Loss of Membership Eligibility </h3>
					<p> Membership in the SSSC does not bestow LSST data access rights. SSSC members who move from an institution or country with LSST data rights to one 
						without LSST data rights may lose their membership eligibility. These individuals will need to make arrangements with the LSST Corporation to 
						retain LSST data rights in order to remain eligible for LSST SSSC membership. </p> 
					
					<h3> Pre-Charter Collaboration Members </h3> 
					<p> SSSC members who joined before the establishment of this Charter who have no change in institution or status since the date the Charter was adopted 
						are grandfathered in as members of the SSSC. SSSC members admitted before the charter without LSST data access rights will need to make separate 
						arrangements with the LSST Corporation if they want to be able to use non-public LSST data and derived data products. </p> 
					
					<h3> Revocation of Membership </h3>
					<p> SSSC members who grossly violate the rules of this Charter or violate the <a href="http://lsst-sssc.github.io/codeofconduct.html"> SSSC Code of Conduct</a> may be asked to leave the collaboration at the sole 
						discretion of the SSSC co-chairs after consultation with the SSSC working group leads and the LSST Corporation Science Collaboration Coordinator.</p>
					
					<h3> Leadership </h3>
					<p> The SSSC leadership consists of two chairs who share responsibilities for organizing and managing the SSSC efforts. </p> 

					<p> Responsibilities of the SSSC co-chairs include: </p>
					<ul>
						<li> organizing the collaboration’s efforts to best utilize LSST data </li>
						<li> serving as a liaison between the project science team, LSST data management, and the collaboration </li>
						<li> working together with data management to ensure the needs of the SSSC are being met </li>
						<li> organizing SSSC communications </li>
						<li> planning SSSC meetings </li>
						<li> serving as public spokespersons for the SSSC </li> 
						<li> ensuring that Solar System science has a voice in the future of LSST, through organizing SSSC contributions to the 
							LSST science book, Observing Strategy Whitepaper, Deep Drilling Field Whitepapers, Mini-survey Whitepapers, etc </li> 
					</ul>
 					<p> Each SSSC co-chair will have a three-year term, with no limit on repeat terms if re-elected. Each co-chair position will have its own separate election as
					needed. Candidate nominations and elections for SSSC co-chair will be organized by the LSST Corporation Science Collaboration Coordinator. If the 
					Science Collaboration Coordinator is not available, the leadership of another LSST Science Collaboration will be enlisted to organize and coordinate a
					SSSC co-chair election. </p>
					
					<p> Concerns about the actions or behaviors of the SSSC Co-chairs, can be raised directly to one or both of the Co-chairs, the SSSC Working Group Leads, and/or
					the LSST Corporation Science Collaboration Coordinator. </p>
				
					<h3> Working Groups </h3>
					
					<p> Working groups may be established within the SSSC. New working groups may be proposed by the SSSC membership at any time. The SSSC Co-chairs shall decide the
						list of active working groups in consultation with the collaboration and existing working group leads. </p>
					
					<p> Each active working group will have at least one working group lead. Working group leads report to the SSSC co-Chairs. Each working group lead will have a two-year term, 
						with no limit on repeat terms if re-elected.  The nomination, election, and appointment of working group leads will be organized as needed under the supervision of 
						the SSSC Co-chairs. </p> 
					<h3> Changes to the SSSC Charter and the SSSC Code of Conduct </h3>
					
					<p> Changes to the <a href="http://lsst-sssc.github.io/charter.html"> SSSC Charter </a> and the <a href="http://lsst-sssc.github.io/codeofconduct.html"> SSSC Code of Conduct</a> may be proposed by the SSSC co-chairs. After feedback on the proposed changes from the SSSC membership, the SSSC 
					   co-chairs will organize a collaboration wide vote. The proposed changes are adopted if 2/3rds of the votes cast are in favor. </p> 
					
					<h3> Publication Coordinators </h3>
					
					<p> The SSSC will have two publication coordinators to help SSSC members follow the collaboration’s publication policy. Details of their role is described in the SSSC Publication Policy.  Publication Coordinators report to the SSSC co-Chairs. 
						Each publication coordinator will have a two-year term, with no limit on repeat terms if re-elected. The nomination, election,
						and appointment of Publication Coordinators will be organized as needed under the supervision of the SSSC Co-chairs.  </p> 

					<h3> Voting </h3>
					
					<p> Votes of the SSSC membership will be required for: </p>
					<ul> 
						<li> electing the Co-chairs </li>
						<li> electing working group leads </li>
						<li> electing working publication coordinators </li>
						<li> making additions or changes to the <a href="http://lsst-sssc.github.io/charter.html">SSSC Charter</a> </li>
						<li> making additions or changes to the <a href="http://lsst-sssc.github.io/codeofconduct.html">SSSC Code of Conduct</a> </li>
						<li> making additions or changes to the <a href="http://lsst-sssc.github.io/publication_policy.html">SSSC Publication Policy</a> </li>

					</ul>
					
					
					<p> The SSSC co-chairs may call for a vote to gauge consensus or endorsement from the SSSC on an issue or proposal from time to time as needed. </p>
						
					<p> Changes to the <a href="http://lsst-sssc.github.io/charter.html"> SSSC Charter </a> and the <a href="http://lsst-sssc.github.io/codeofconduct.html">SSSC Code of Conduct</a> will be adopted
						only if 2/3rds of the votes cast are in favor. All other collaboration 
						wide elections, including election of the SSSC Co-chairs, will be decided by the majority of the votes cast. A proposal, proposition, or
						candidate will be considered to have been selected if the majority of the votes cast are in favor. 	</p>
