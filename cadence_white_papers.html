						<h3> Simultaneous LSST and Euclid observations - advantages for Solar System Objects  </h3>
						<p> Snodgrass et al. - <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00607">Arxiv link</a></p>
						<p> <b> Abstract: </b> The ESA Euclid mission is a space telescope that will survey ~15,000 square degrees of the sky, primarily to study the distant universe (constraining cosmological parameters through the lensing of galaxies). It is also expected to observe ~150,000 Solar System Objects (SSOs), primarily in poorly understood high inclination populations, as it will mostly avoid +/-15 degrees from the ecliptic plane. With a launch date of 2022 and a 6 year survey, Euclid and LSST will operate at the same time, and have complementary capabilities. We propose a LSST mini-survey to coordinate quasi-simultaneous observations between these two powerful observatories, when possible, with the primary aim of greatly improving the orbits of SSOs discovered by these facilities. As Euclid will operate from a halo orbit around the Sun-Earth L2 Lagrangian point, there will be significant parallax between observations from Earth and Euclid (0.01 AU). This means that simultaneous observations will give an independent distance measurement to SSOs, giving additional constraints on orbits compared to single Euclid visits. </p>

						<h3> A near-Sun Solar System Twilight Survey with LSST </h3>
						<p> Seaman et al. - <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00466">Arxiv link</a></p>
						<p> <b> Abstract: </b> We propose a LSST Solar System near-Sun Survey, to be implemented during twilight hours, that extends the seasonal reach of LSST to its maximum as fresh sky is uncovered at about 50 square degrees per night (1500 sq. deg. per lunation) in the morning eastern sky, and surveyable sky is lost at the same rate to the western evening sky due to the Earth's synodic motion. By establishing near-horizon fence post picket lines to the far west and far east we address Solar System science use cases (including Near Earth Objects, Interior Earth Objects, Potentially Hazardous Asteroids, Earth Trojans, near-Sun asteroids, sun-grazing comets, and dormant comets) as well as provide the first look and last look that LSST will have at the transient and variable objects within each survey field. This proposed near-Sun Survey will also maximize the overlap with the field of regard of the proposed NEOCam spacecraft that will be stationed at the Earth's L1 Lagrange point and survey near quadrature with the Sun. This will allow LSST to incidently follow-up NEOCam targets and vice-versa (as well as targets from missions such as Euclid), and will roughly correspond to the Earth's L4 and L5 regions.  </p>

						<h3>  The Effects of Filter Choice on Outer Solar System Science with LSST </h3>
						<p> Volk et al. - <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00937">Arxiv link</a></p>
						<p><b> Abstract: </b> Making an inventory of the Solar System is one of the four pillars that the requirements for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) are built upon. The choice between same-filter nightly pairs or different-filter nightly pairs in the Wide-Fast-Deep (WFD) Survey will have a dramatic effect on the ability of the Moving Object Pipeline System (MOPS) to detect certain classes of Solar System objects; many of the possible filter pairings would result in significant (âˆ¼50% or more) loss of Solar System object detections. In particular, outer Solar System populations can be significantly redder than those in the inner Solar System, and nightly pairs in r-band will result in the deepest survey for the outer Solar System. To maximize the potential for outer Solar System science, we thus advocate for ensuring that the WFD survey contains a sufficient number of r-r nightly pairs for each field during a discovery season to ensure detection and linking using MOPS. We also advocate for adding additional spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that more accurately model outer Solar System populations to the pipeline for evaluating the outputs of the LSST operations simulator. This will enable a better estimate of how many Solar System population detections are lost or gained for different filter choices in the WFD survey. </p>
