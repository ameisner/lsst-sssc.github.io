						<h2>SSSC Software</h2>
						<p>Here you will find a description of on-going software development (and related plans) and also a description of the LSST project produced Moving Object Pipeline System (MOPS).</p>
					</header>
					
					 <H2> Moving Object Pipeline System (MOPS) </H2>
						<p> The  Moving Object Pipeline System (MOPS) will be the main software to identify moving Solar System objects in LSST data.
						MOPS is a deliverable from LSST data management. This effort is being lead by the LSST Solar System Processing Team based at the University of Washington.

					<ul>
						<li> <b>2017 </b> - MOPS development plan/schedule to be updated; Begin discussion of solar system data product definitions with SSSC
						<li> <b>2018 </b> - Validate MOPS by running on ZTF alert stream; Develop agreements with the MPC; Finalize Solar System data product definitions and operational protocols
						<li> <b> 2019 </b> - Rewrite the linkTracklets stage; Computation of derived quantities' Integrate into the Level 1 processing system 
						<li> <b> 2020+ </b> - Validate on comcam data; integration with the MPC

				<H3> MOPS Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</H3>
				<p>
					<b> What will be in the catalog? Can we still change what’s going to be measured for Solar System Objects? </b>
					<br>
					The <a href="https://docushare.lsstcorp.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/LSE-163/">Data Products Definition Document (DPDD)</a> defines the outline of what the catalog will contain, but adding more detail via discussions with the SSSC is on-going.
					We can make changes as long as they don’t affect budget and schedule, but before the end of 2018 the bulk of the data product format/items should be set. 

					<br>
					<br>
					<b> What will you do with trailed sources & non-linear motion (nearby/geocentric)?</b>
					<br>
					Trailed sources will be detected and characterized, but we will not attempt to fit anything other than heliocentric/barycentric fits. 
					N.b. trailed sources should be easy to pick out of the alert stream, in real-time.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b> Will MOPS do forced photometry of Solar System objects? </b>
					<br>
				        No. 
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>  Can we expect comets, including bright ones, to be treated like any other source in the sky, or if there may be biases against them? </b>
					<br> 
					  Difference image source detection will find anything that reaches the 5-sigma threshold after convolving with a PSF (point spread function); unless it’s both a very faint (low surface brightness) and very extended comet, it will be detected. 
					  Comet candidates should be easy to detect very early, even before MOPS links an orbit; in the alert stream one can look for adjacent, single-apparition, extended objects that appear in 20-minute visit pairs.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b> How does MOPS centroid on comet comae and does it avoid astrometry biases due to coma and tail asymmetries? </b>
					<br> 
					The centroiding algorithm derives from the SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) one, that’s been designed to appropriately centroid galaxies that may also exhibit asymmetries.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b> Is there going to be a MOPS built specific to each population (Inner/Outer/NEO)? </b>
					<br>
					Not unless we have to to meet requirements.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b> Will the MOPS design document be updated (<a href="https://msweb.lsstcorp.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Version-24308/LDM-156.pdf">LDM-156</a>)? </b>
				        <br> 
					Yes, as we revisit the design in 2018.
