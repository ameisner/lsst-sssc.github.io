During LSST development I've worked on metrics related to asteroid observation. I have worked on direct detection techniques for exoplanets - OK, not solar system exactly, but related."

I am interested in both dynamical classification based on short-term integrations and long-term dynamical behavior. I anticipate using these classifications to study collisional families and other interesting dynamical effects. I am interested in using and encouraging rigorous statistical methods wherever possible. "

As the MPC Director, I am very interested in the processing and flow of astrometry to the MPC, particular of NEO candidates."
