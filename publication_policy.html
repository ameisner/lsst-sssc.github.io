						<h2>SSSC Publication Policy</h2>
					</header>
					
						<h3> Scope/Types of Papers </h3>
						<p> The policy below applies to manuscripts, white papers, or other documents that are planned to be published/made
							publicly available in peer-reviewed journals (e.g. ApJ/MNRAS), preprint servers (e.g astroPh/ArXiv), or
							other formally published mediums (such as Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society), that make 
							use of LSST data or derived LSST data products and include SSSC members as authors/coauthors. For brevity,
							the term ‘paper’ will be used below when referring to all of these kinds of written materials.Exempt from 
							this policy are: student theses, conference abstracts (e.g. DPS/LPSC abstracts), colloquia/seminar talk abstracts,
							and other brief notices that contain less than half a page of text, such as ATels (Astronomer’s Telegram), 
							CBETs (Central Bureau Electronic Telegrams), & Minor Planet  Electronic Circulars (MPECs). </p>
					
					<h3> When Is the Publication Policy Voluntary </h3>
					<p> If the paper contains/utilizes LSST data products/software/data available to all data rights holders or makes use of 
						publicly released LSST data/derived products, then the SSSC Publications Policy is optional and voluntary, but 
						recommended. When Is the Publication Policy Mandatory: The publication policy is mandatory if the paper contains/makes
						use of proprietary SSSC Community Products. </p>
					
					<h3> Research Exclusivity </h3>
					<p> No individual or group owns a specific research topic. All SSSC members can pursue a paper on any research topic/project 
						of their choosing.  </p>
					
					<h3> Publication Coordinators </h3>
					
					<p> The SSSC will have two publication coordinators whose roles are  to guide manuscripts through the collaboration publication 
						policy process. They also will maintain the SSSC Architects list and the list of proprietary SSSC Community Products. 
						The publication coordinators will also ensure that the SSSC has access to these lists. They will also be responsible for
						maintaining a public version of the SSSC Architects list.  </p>
					
					<h3> Proprietary SSSC Community Products </h3>
					 
					<p> These are catalogs, software, and other products designated as such by their creators. If a data product uses a
						proprietary SSSC Community Product, it is automatically considered to be a Proprietary SSSC Community Product itself. 
						If the specific data product or software becomes publicly available (published online or published in a journal), or
						becomes incorporated as a LSST project data/software product, then it will at that point forward no longer be considered
						a proprietary SSSC Community Product. The SSSC Publication Coordinators will maintain the list of proprietary SSSC 
						Community Products. Producing Proprietary SSSC Community Products will not grant LSST Data Rights, but may lead to
						SSSC Architect status.  </p>
					
					<h3> Overview of Publication Review Process </h3>
					<p> This policy covers two separate processes for papers: 1) Working Group Review 2) Extending co-authorship to Architects. If the
						paper is on the voluntary track, authors can ask for working group review and not go through with extending authorship to 
						the Architects (or vice versa). Publications that follow the mandatory track, must do both aspects of the publication policy.</p>
					
					<h3> Working Group Review </h3>
					
					<p> The publication coordinators with consultation from the lead author will select which working group(s) should 
						receive the paper. They will send out the paper draft to the selected working group(s) with a deadline for 
						review.  </p>
					
					<p> Paper comments and feedback are expected to be sent directly to the lead author. Members of working groups are encouraged
						but not required to send feedback on all papers sent for working group review. </p>
					
					<p> Working group review is not an endorsement of a paper. It provides an opportunity to strengthen manuscripts and also inform 
						the collaboration of on-going research efforts within the SSSC. The lead author is not obligated to respond to all manuscript
						comments received. It is up to the lead author of the paper to decide what to do with the feedback they receive. The lead author 
						does not need to make the requested changes to the paper if they disagree with the received feedback.  </p>
					
					<p> If a paper goes through working group review, we ask that the following text be added to the paper’s acknowledgements section: <br>
						<i> We thank the LSST Solar System Science Collaboration for manuscript feedback<i> </p>
